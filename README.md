# Personal Portfolio JPGuerrero1
## Description

This personal portfolio is an extension and journal of coding projects, tech skills, and web development knowledge acquired while learning as a developer. The portfolio was made to document the learning journey as a developer, adding more code and projects as more complex web development concepts are learned, with the end goal being a fully revised and professional tech portfolio to offer to future employers.

## What Problem Did This Challenge Solve?

This starter-portfolio solves the real-world issue of developing a professional portfolio that will one day be presented and hopefully entice future employers, showing off what skills a developer knows and how proficient in those skills they are.
